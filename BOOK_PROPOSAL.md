# LEAN Canvas Book Proposal

## Problem


- Information and data theory has major gaps and lacks standardization
- Multiple apparently competing (incompatible) paradigms exist supported by commercial interests that leave major gaps in industry-wide understanding around data practice
- Data practices vary and most guidelines have been constraint-limited, are outdated, and/or do not fully cover all related topics (i.e. are incomplete in scope)

### Existing Alternatives
- Learning paradigms offered by technical modeling methods (i.e. dimensional modeling, snowflake, etc.)
- Basing practice on language structure (e.g. SQL-based data modeling)
- Basing pratice on tooling/products like DBT-based or Looker-based data modeling
